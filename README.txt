       =======  QuasiPycies =======

Python 3 module to calculate diversity indices from NGS data. It consists of two main 
classes (Clusters and Pileup) and extra functions for convertion and parsing 
different file formats.

class Clusters 
	It uses a fasta file as input. The fasta file must have number of reads
	("size=") on each sequence name and the respective percentage. It can be
	generated by using clustering tools like Usearch or BBmap that write the
	number of reads for each cluster.

	eg:

	>ReadA;size=180_90.0%
	AAATTTCCCGGG
	>ReadB;size=20_10.0%
	TTTAAATTTGGG 

	Functions:  shannon_entropy
				simpsons_index
				simpsons_index_of_diversity
				simpsons_Reciprocal_Index
				clusters_object_to_fasta
				filtering_clusters_by_percentage
				number_haplotypes
				filtering_Clusters

class Pileup
	It uses a mpileup file as input. The mpileup file can be generated from
	a SAM/BAM file using samtools (more information in README file). The 
	information of stacked bases for each position in the alignment is used
	to calculated intrapopulation heterogeneity. 
		
	Functions:  nucleotide_diversity
				polymorphic_sites


Extra functions
				filtering_clusters_by_percentage
				sam_to_fasta
				fastq_to_fasta
				multiline_fasta_to_singleline
				clusters_to_single_reads
